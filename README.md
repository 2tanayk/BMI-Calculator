# BMI-Calculator
A mini app dev. project  to implement a BMI calculator!

I made this app as an assigment to join my college's app dev. club,It was a short and a solo project.
The app accepts inputs in kg and m/cm or pounds and inches and uses the BMI formula: (weight)/(height)^2 and gives the output.I used three activities.
I learned to implement a splash screen,to use spinners and using Intents(links below)

I have also handled the exceptional cases and displayed the mistake accordingly using a Toast message
